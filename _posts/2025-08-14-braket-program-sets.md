Amazon Braket now supports program sets, enabling quantum researchers to run complex workloads requiring hundreds of quantum circuit executions up to 24X faster. This new feature allows customers to submit up to 100 quantum programs or a single parametric circuit with up to 100 parameter values within a single quantum task. Program sets help minimize the time between subsequent circuit executions reducing quantum task processing overhead for complex algorithms.
