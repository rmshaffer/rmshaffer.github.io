AutoQASM provides a natural interface for expressing quantum programs with mid-circuit measurements and classical control flow using native Python language features. It allows the construction of modular programs consisting of common programming constructs such as loops and subroutines. This enables a more imperative programming style than constructing programs via a series of function calls on a circuit object.

We describe the motivation and guiding principles of the open-source AutoQASM library, which optimizes for familiarity to Python developers and for interoperability with other tools. We describe how AutoQASM can be used to implement various quantum programming paradigms such as real-time classical control flow, device-native programming, and custom pulse-level gate calibrations. Finally, we discuss possible future enhancements to AutoQASM to make it even more useful for real-world applications.
