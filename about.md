I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at UC Berkeley.
As a member of the [HÃ¤ffner lab](http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/haeffner/),
my research interests include experimental trapped-ion quantum computing
and experimental verification of quantum simulation and computation.

I have over a decade of software engineering experience at Microsoft
as an individual contributor, technical leader, and people manager.
