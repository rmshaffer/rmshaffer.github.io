Welcome! I'm Ryan Shaffer, a quantum computing scientist and software engineer passionate about advancing the frontiers of technology. I currently work on [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/), a fully managed quantum computing service on AWS that provides access to state-of-the-art quantum simulators and quantum computing hardware. My career spans over 15 years at leading tech companies like Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon, where I've been fortunate to be a part of world-class teams in software engineering and applied science.

With a strong academic foundation in physics, computer science, electrical engineering, and management, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications. For more about my background, visit the [About](./about.md) page.

# Recent Papers

- [**Sample-efficient verification of continuously-parameterized quantum gates**](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-05-04-997/)  
  ([**PDF**](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-05-04-997/pdf/))  
  *This paper introduces a novel method for efficiently verifying quantum gates on small quantum processors. By leveraging sample-efficient techniques, the approach minimizes the resources required for gate verification, making it particularly useful for near-term quantum devices.*  
  **Authors**: Ryan Shaffer, Hang Ren, Emiliia Dyrenkova, Christopher G. Yale, Daniel S. Lobser, Ashlyn D. Burch, Matthew N. H. Chow, Melissa C. Revelle, Susan M. Clark, Hartmut Häffner  
  **Published in**: Quantum 7, 997 (2023)

- [**Surrogate-based optimization for variational quantum algorithms**](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.032415)  
  ([**PDF**](./papers/PhysRevA.107.032415.pdf))  
  *This work explores the use of surrogate models to optimize variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). By approximating the cost function landscape, surrogate models reduce the computational overhead of optimization, enabling faster convergence and improved performance in hybrid quantum-classical workflows.*  
  **Authors**: Ryan Shaffer, Lucas Kocia, Mohan Sarovar  
  **Published in**: Phys. Rev. A 107, 032415 (2023)

- [**Practical verification protocols for analog quantum simulators**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00380-8)  
  ([**PDF**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00380-8.pdf?dl=0))  
  *This paper proposes practical and scalable methods for verifying the accuracy of analog quantum simulators. The protocols are designed to be robust against noise and imperfections, making them suitable for real-world experimental setups.*  
  **Authors**: Ryan Shaffer, Eli Megidish, Joseph Broz, Wei-Ting Chen, Hartmut Häffner  
  **Published in**: npj Quantum Information 7, 46 (2021)
