Hi! I'm Ryan Shaffer. 
I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Physics at UC Berkeley.
As a member of the [Häffner lab](http://research.physics.berkeley.edu/haeffner/),
my research interests include experimental trapped-ion quantum computing
and experimental verification of quantum simulation and computation.

I have over a decade of software engineering experience at Microsoft
as an individual contributor, technical leader, and people manager.

For more about me, see the [About](./about.md) page.
