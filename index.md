I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Häffner group](https://ions.berkeley.edu)
at UC Berkeley and the
[NSF Challenge Institute for Quantum Computation (CIQC)](https://ciqc.berkeley.edu).
I'm also a graduate student intern in the [OVER-QC group](https://overqc.sandia.gov/)
at Sandia National Laboratories.
My research interests include trapped-ion quantum computing, quantum circuit synthesis,
and experimental verification of analog quantum simulations.

Outside of my research pursuits, I have spent over ten years in the software engineering
world as an individual contributor, technical leader, and people manager.

For more about me, see the [About](./about.md) page.
