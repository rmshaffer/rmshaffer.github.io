I'm an applied scientist working on [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/),
a fully managed quantum computing service available through Amazon Web Services (AWS)
which provides access to a variety of quantum simulators and quantum computing hardware.

My academic background includes degrees in physics, computer science, electrical engineering, and management.
My industry career spans 15+ years at Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon.
For more about me, see the [About](./about.md) page.
